        <li>Easy Access
        Cloud-based clinic management software allows healthcare providers to access, record, 
        store, and check patients’ data whenever needed. 
        This especially helps in situations when a doctor needs to check a patient’s medical history 
        or make a diagnosis, as all the data is in one place.</li>
        
        <li>Hospital Automation
        Clinic management software automates repetitive administrative tasks, such as data entry
        manual appointment bookings helping in going paperless. Reduced Errors Due to work process 
        automation, there is a lesser chance for human error since there is minimal human intervention.</li>
        
        <li>Data Security
        It isn’t news that the security of information plays a significant role in the healthcare industry.
        Any created software in medicine should be compliant with the regulations of the country. 
        In the USA, for instance, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), in 
        Canada – PIPEDA. Clinic management software interacts with electronic health records, a collection of 
        electronic data on each patient. This means that the clinic management system has access to 
        patients’ records.Custom hospital management software is built in such a way that only authorized 
        users that have their own assigned ID can access the software.</li>
        
       <li>Flexibility
        Clinic management software is suitable both for small-, middle- and large-sized clinics. 
        The set of clinic management software features can be pretty minimal at first, but then it can 
        be scaled and adjusted. The software will grow the way a clinic does.</li>
        
        <li>Cost Effectiveness
        Clinic management software optimizes the number of needed employees by automating such manual 
        tasks as:
        performing billing procedures
        submitting insurance claims
        generating reports for staff members.
        In this way, clinics save on hiring extra staff and avoid overworking employees.</li>
